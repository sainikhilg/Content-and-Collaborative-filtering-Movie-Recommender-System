# Content-and-Collaborative-filtering-Movie-Recommender-System

This is a student project for the course Cloud Computing using Data Analysis.

Content based filtering is done based on the genre for most liked movies and recommending the top five movies of the genre. the code content.py is the code file for it

Collaborative filtering is done based on the ALS (without MLlib). Matrix factorization is done using the latent factors optimization using Apache Spark (RDDs)

Nearest Neighbour algorithm is also implemented for Collaborative filtering using cosine similarity
